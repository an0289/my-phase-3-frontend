# My Phase 3 Project 

Hello! Take a peek at some of the exciting games 2023 has to offer while reminiscing about the amazing games 2022 gave us. Feel free to leave reviews for any of the games you've played and if you happen to have a game that you're excited to see come out in 2023, go ahead and add it to the list!

## Programming Languages 

[React.js](https://react.dev/) and [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com/) are responsible for the design of this app, while [Ruby's Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and [Sinatra](https://sinatrarb.com/) were used to create the backend data.
                        

## Usage

Users can view games that are set to come out in 2023 in an easy-to-read card format that displays the game's name, an image of the game's title, release date, which platforms the game will be released on, and a link to the game's website.

The Top Game of 2022 contains a list of the top 10 games of 2022 and includes the game's ranking, developers, platforms, and genre.

Oh no! Did the release date for that one game you've been super excited for get pushed back? Well, thankfully, users can edit the game card to have the most current release date show.

Is there a game that you've been looking forward to that isn't shown? Go ahead and click the green "add" button on the top of the page so it can be added to the list.

Did you add a game that you're no longer excited for, or the release date pushes it back another year? The handy "delete" button located near the bottom of the card will remove it from the list.

Both anticipated games and the top 10 games of 2022 have a reviews section that can be hidden or shown. Users are free to add, edit, or delete a review they felt for a game.
